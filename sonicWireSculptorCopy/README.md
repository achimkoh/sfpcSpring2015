This is an attempt to recreate Amit Pitaru's Sonic Wire Sculptor(2003) in openFrameworks.

Original project: http://www.sonicwiresculptor.com/

During the Spring 2015 session of the School for Poetic Computation, I was for the first time properly introduced to coding, using openFrameworks. One homework from Zachary Lieberman's class consisted of making a drawing tool, and I wanted to do something sound-related; I decided to recreate this instrument and it ended up being my project for our final event. This version is based on what was shown at Babycastles, the event venue. It has some last-minute features such as video recording.

While making this I received help from lots of people in and around the School for Poetic Computation, including but not limited to Zach Lieberman, Mike Walczyk, Johan Bichel Lindegaard and Michael P. Allison. I am very thankful to them. I would also like to thank Amit for his generosity on my presenting a copy of his work.

Basically this is a mixture of a lot of examples I found online, including:
- https://github.com/ofZach/drawing-examples/tree/master/3d
- https://github.com/ofZach/avsys2012/tree/master/week2_oscillator (I started off by mashing these two examples together, and then decided to use ofSoundPlayer to produce sound)

To run the app, put this repo two levels below the openframeworks directory. (e.g. ~/openframeworks/apps/sonicWireSculptorCopy/)
